## 📖 Project Description
This project presents an **Educational Recommendation System** developed using **Python** and **Jupyter Notebook**.  

The goal of the system is to **recommend universities and study programs** to students based on their:  
- Geographical location (home county vs. university city)  
- Academic performance (e.g., Baccalaureate results)  
- Preferences and patterns detected with machine learning  

The project combines **data analysis, machine learning models, and visualization techniques** to offer personalized recommendations.

## ✨ Key Features
- 🗺 **Geolocation-based recommendations** – Match students with universities close to their location.  
- 📊 **Performance analysis** – Use student academic results for better recommendations.  
- 🤖 **Machine learning models** – Techniques include Random Forest regression, clustering, collaborative and content-based filtering.  
- 📈 **Visualizations** – Graphs and charts illustrate patterns in student admissions and recommendation results.  
- 🗄 **Educational datasets** – Data about high school students, their results, and Romanian universities.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Machine Learning**:  
  - Random Forest Regressor  
  - OneHot Encoding  
  - Clustering (K-Means, hierarchical methods)  
  - Collaborative Filtering  
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib & Seaborn
